    Function returns an imported object from AFNI's python modules.
    Currently this is required because AFNI's python code is not installed. It
    is on the system path. When on the path, the .py files can be run as an
    executable from anywhere but not imported. It's use should be limited with
    a view to eventually eradicate its need.

        module: A python module imported from AFNI's installation directory
